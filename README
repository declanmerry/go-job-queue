# Go Job Queue

This project implements a small HTTP API in Go that accepts jobs, persists them to SQLite, processes them asynchronously using worker pools, and exposes endpoints to query status and cancel jobs.

Design choices and notable features:
- Persistent job metadata in SQLite so the system can recover after restarts.
- Dispatcher goroutine that pulls queued jobs and assigns them to worker pools.
- Separate worker pools per job type (simple example): `http_webhook`, `image_resize` (simulated), and `compute_task` (simulated CPU task).
- Exponential backoff retry with max attempts and dead-letter behavior.
- Progress updates saved to DB so clients can poll for progress.

Run:
- `go mod tidy`
- `go run ./...`

Tests:
- `go test ./...`
